				<p>Some of you may remember Dirk from the AGM where he wasn't shown, but attended with
				his dam - Euchee Creek's Red Sofia. Dirk is halter broke. Although he looks like he's
				black, he is an unusual expression of wild red, just like his sire T3 Darragh. His dam
				is both ADCA and Legacy registered. Sofia's calves tend to grow quickly, level out as
				yearlings in height and continue to put on muscle mass. </p>

				making payments on her with money she has raised cleaning barn stalls and working around
				the house. The funds from Mouse will go towards her new heifer “Gracie”.</p>
