				<p>Gwen has been part of our show string this summer.  She is a nice heifer
				that is structurally correct in her stance & stride. Her blood lines go back
				to some of our best cattle.  She is a non-carrier of PHA & Chondrodysplacia.
				Her polled status (homo or hetero) and A2/A2 status are pending.  Results should
				be available by sale.  Look for her in the Open Show.  She would make a great
				addition for your herd or a great foundation female to start a new herd.</p>
